# MavuDupe - Duplicate and Rename Multiple Files

**Duplicate multiple files at once using your well-earned multi-cursor-editing-skills.**

i had the need to duplicate Phoenix-Liveview-Components, which consist often of foo.ex and foo.html.leex-files which i need to duplicate at en-bloc.

so i made this version by changing some lines of code in the Extension "Batch Rename" by "JannisX11".



### How To Use:

* Select files in the explorer sidebar
* Right click one of the selected files and click "Duplicate and Rename Multiple Files [MavuDupe]"
* Edit the file names in the editor
* Hit Save to confirm
