# Duplicate and Rename Multiple Files (mavu-dupe)

**Duplicate multiple files at once using your well-earned multi-cursor-editing-skills.**

i had the need to duplicate Phoenix-Liveview-Components, which consist often of foo.ex and foo.html.leex-files which i need to duplicate at en-bloc.


### How To Use:

* Select files in the explorer sidebar
* Right click one of the selected files and click "Duplicate and Rename Multiple Files [MavuDupe]"
* Edit the file names in the editor
* Hit Save to confirm

### Example renaming 3 files: 

<div>&nbsp;</div>

### Credits

based on the VSCode-Extension "Batch Rename" by "JannisX11"

if only it could duplicate files instead of renaming them. so i created this version by modifying JannisX11's Extension (which wasn't on github, otherwise i'd PR'd)
